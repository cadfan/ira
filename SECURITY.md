# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ira, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

**Contact:** Open a private security advisory through GitHub's Security tab, or contact the repository owner directly.

**Please include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## Response

I'll acknowledge receipt and provide updates as the issue is investigated and resolved. Credit will be given to reporters unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope

This policy covers the ira application code. Issues with iRacing itself should be reported to iRacing directly.
